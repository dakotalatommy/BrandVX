\# Project Overview & Simulation Entry Prompt

\#\# Purpose  
This document serves as the \*\*starting point\*\* for any AI session.    
It loads \*\*all project context\*\*, defines the \*\*execution roles\*\*, and runs the \*\*Temporal Synthesis Simulation\*\* before any task execution.

\#\# Context Summary  
\*\*Project:\*\* BrandVX Development    
\*\*Core Approach:\*\* Human–AI–AI Architect Execution Model    
\*\*Primary Goal:\*\* Enable one-shot creation of functional, deployable software applications (starting with the Beauty Automation Platform), with reusable architecture scalable up to AAA game complexity.    
\*\*Extended Goal:\*\* Support distribution of \*\*pre-trained client models\*\* that integrate into BrandVX, enabling hierarchical data access across:  
\- \*\*H-Level\*\* (Aube Creative Labs – full client portfolio insights)  
\- \*\*L-Level\*\* (Client-specific AI models – local business data)  
\- \*\*User-Level\*\* (End-user or client’s customer data)

\#\# Role Definitions  
\- \*\*Human:\*\* Provides vision, goals, and brand context.  
\- \*\*Architect AI:\*\* Translates vision into executable technical scaffolding and workflows.  
\- \*\*Builder AI:\*\* Implements functional code, integrations, and UI, passing acceptance tests.

\#\# Execution Flow  
1\. \*\*Load all included documents\*\* and parse into an integrated mental model.  
2\. \*\*Run \`TEMPORAL\_SYNTHESIS\_INSTRUCTIONS.md\` in full\*\* before any execution.  
3\. Retain the \*\*Final Temporal Synthesis State\*\* as the active global context.  
4\. Apply the \*\*One-Shot Coding Framework\*\* to:  
   \- Generate complete app scaffolding.  
   \- Implement acceptance tests.  
   \- Integrate external APIs, CRMs, booking data, and analytics.  
5\. Deploy the app in one iteration, ensuring:  
   \- All role responsibilities are fulfilled.  
   \- H-Level and L-Level data segregation rules are respected.  
   \- User/Admin view separation is enforced based on login type.
