# Trace Log (Bootstrap Execution)

- Loaded: `Master Repo README.md` → confirmed H→L and execution flow
- Loaded: `Boot Instructions/README.md`, `H-L_Hierarchy_Map.md`, `RCLP.md`, `SYSTEM_GAP_CLOSURE.md`, `quickstart.md`
- Loaded (H): `BrandVX Technical/*` including runtime boot, acceptance tests, data model/events, integrations, RBAC, one-shot exec, supplemental context framework
- Loaded (L): `BrandVX Brand-Voice/*` including runtime brand boot, UX overview, one-shot brand guide, file map
- Context library acknowledged (binary docs summarized by title only; see risks): PDFs/DOCX under `GitHub Repo Docs/`

Key decisions
- Use FastAPI backend scaffold with event emitters matching `BRANDVX_DATA_MODEL_EVENTS.md`
- Provide minimal web UI stub; split Admin vs Practitioner in future sprints
- Persist FTSS, sprint plan, and risks; map demo path to ATs

Artifacts created
- `synthesis/FTSS.json`
- `synthesis/risks.md`
- `docs/plan/sprint_plan_week_1.md`
- Backend scaffold under `src/backend/app` and minimal web stub under `src/web`

Event policy
- All endpoints emit events (names per taxonomy); logs redact PII; tenant scoping expected in future auth pass
