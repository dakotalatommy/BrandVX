**BrandVX — End-to-End User Experience** **\(Plain-Language Spec\) **

This is how the whole platform should feel and behave from a **user’s** point of view. Hand this to GPT-5 in Cursor and say “build what this document describes.” 



**Who’s who **

● **Operator \(your client\)**: a beauty professional \(e.g., vivid colorist, lash artist\) who uses BrandVX. 



● **End client**: their customer booking services. 



● **BrandVX \(master agent\)**: orchestrates everything. 



● **Specialists**: Appointment Manager, Treatment Manager \(Vivid Hair/Lash\), Content Creator, Inventory Manager, Admin/Revenue. 





**1\) Onboarding — what the operator does first **

1. **Create account** → name, business name, phone, email. 



2. **Connect tools** \(al optional but guided\): 



○ **HubSpot** \(for CRM sync\) 



○ **Square/Acuity** \(calendar & booking\) 



○ **SendGrid** \(email\) 



○ Optional: **Shopify/Square POS** \(products/inventory\), **QuickBooks** \(revenue\) 3. **Import data**: 



○ Upload CSV/PDF/“export” from current system \(clients, booking history, products\). 



○ Map fields \(we show a preview and auto-match common columns\). 



○ Confirm. 



4. **Business preferences**: 



○ Services, duration, prices, availability, cancel ation policy. 



○ Reminder settings \(default: **7d / 3d / 1d / 2h** before appointments\). 



○ “Soonest vs Anytime” preference defaults. 



5. **Trial setup** \(optional\): 



○ Enable **free week** onboarding \(white-glove\). 



○ Choose welcome message template. 



6. **Sharing & Time Saver**: 



○ Toggle **“Show Time Saved” ** widget to clients \(on/off\). 



○ Toggle **“Allow share prompts” ** \(on/off\). 



○ Connect socials if they want one-click posting later. 



7. **Finish screen**: 



○ “You’re live.” 



○ Optional **Share** button \(“I just launched with BrandVX”\) that creates a ready-to-post card. 



○ Next steps checklist: “Import complete”, “Templates set”, “First campaign scheduled”. 



**Expected outcome:** They land in the **Operator Dashboard** with cards \(Time Saved, Revenue Uplift, Usage Index, Referrals\) and a short guided tour. 



**2\) Day-to-day — what happens automatically** **A\) New leads arrive **

● **Inbound \(warm\)** via HubSpot form, referral, or manual add → BrandVX sends a friendly intro text \(email if no phone\). 



● **Outbound \(cold/scraped\)** → BrandVX waits a short delay, then sends a short, value-first text. 



**Branching from first touch: **

● **Replies** → they become **Engaged**. 



● **No reply** → they enter the **Never Answered** cadence. 



● **“Not interested” ** → they go to **Retargeting \(Disinterested\)** for a polite two-step counteroffer. 



**B\) Never Answered cadence \(SMS-first, emails layered\) **

● **Day 1** after no-answer: send email \(if available\). 



● **2.1 \(2 days\)**: fol ow-up text. 



● **2.2 \(1 week\)**: text \+ emails on days 5, 9, 12, 17, 20, 23, 28. 



● **2.3 \(2 weeks\)**: text \+ emails on days 17, 20, 23, 28. 



● **2.4 \(1 month\)**: text \+ weekly emails. 



● **2.5 \(Monthly/Quarter\)**: text at month 2, month 3, and a more emotional text at quarter end. 

If stil no reply → **Retargeting \(No Answer\)** for one last emotional counteroffer. 



**Any reply at any time** moves them to **Engaged**. 

**C\) When someone is engaged **

● **Interested, no meeting yet** → gentle nudges to book \(respectful cadence\). 



● **Meeting booked** → reminders: **7d / 3d / 1d / 2h**. 



● **Rescheduling**: 



○ BrandVX asks “**Soonest vs Anytime**”. 



○ If **Soonest**, the client is added to a **notify-list**; when a cancel ation opens, a targeted SMS goes out so they can grab the slot. 



● **After the meeting**: 



○ If they accept the trial → they’re **Onboarded** and enter **Retention**. 



○ If not → they drop into **Retargeting** with a simple, value-based fol ow-up. 



**D\) Retention & loyalty **

● **Trial week \(5.1\)**: white-glove support \(BrandVX helps but doesn’t spam\). 



● **Month 1 paid \(5.2\)**: white-glove continues; light educational content. 



● **Ongoing \(5.3\)**: friendly nurture cadence \(same tempo as Never Answered, but warm tone\). 



● **Ambassador/Partner monitoring \(5.4\)**: 



○ When they hit **$25k\+ monthly revenue after BrandVX**, **moderate usage**, and 

**≥5 referrals**, they’re flagged as **Ambassador Candidate**. 



○ The operator gets a task/notification to reach out with rev-share/partnership options. 





**3\) Content, Inventory, Admin — what the operator can **

**“do” **

**Content Creator \(easy wins\) **

● Upload a before/after → pick a template \(e.g., **Vivid Hair** / **Lash**\). 



● BrandVX drafts a caption, short video idea, and three story prompts. 



● One-click **Schedule** \(IG/FB\) or **Export** assets. 



● When a post over-performs, the dashboard surfaces it and offers a **Share** moment. 



**Inventory Manager \(no stock surprises\) **

● Sync products from Shopify/Square POS. 



● BrandVX tracks usage \(appointment-linked\) and forecasts **par** levels. 



● When low: show a **Reorder** suggestion and can draft a PO; optional y update product listings across sites. 



**Admin/Revenue \(proof you’re winning\) **

● Pul s QuickBooks snapshots for baseline vs current revenue. 



● Shows **Revenue Uplift** and **Time Saved** \(see below\) and a clean funnel: 



○ impressions → clicks → waitlist → demo booked → show rate → trial → paid → 

retained 





**4\) Time Saver — baked-in, visible, shareable **

● Each automated action has a **baseline minutes** value and an **automation minutes** estimate \(kept realistic\). 

Example: 



○ booking 6 → 1 min, reminder 1 → 0.1, fol ow-up sms 2 → 0.3, caption 10 → 2, inventory update 4 → 0.5 



● **Time saved** = baseline − automation, summed over the day/week/month/lifetime. 



● Milestones at **10h / 25h / 50h / 100h** unlock a **shareable badge**. 



● The **Time Saved** card is on the dashboard with a sparkline, and can be shown to end clients if the operator enables it. 



● Select **inflection points** \(not spammy\) surface a **Share** button with a prefil ed caption and branded image. 



**Default share inflection points \(toggleable\): **

● End of onboarding 



● Trial week complete 



● First ful y booked week 



● **$25k month** achieved 



● **5 referrals** reached 



● Best performing post this month 





**5\) Operator Dashboard — what they see every day **

● **Top cards**: 



○ **Time Saved \(hrs\) **

****

○ **Revenue Uplift \($\) **

****

○ **Usage Index** \(sessions, reply speed, tasks\) 



○ **Referrals \(30d\) **

****

● **Funnel** area: impressions → clicks → waitlist → demo → show → trial → paid → 

retained 



● **Buckets** breakdown: how many contacts are in 1..7 right now 



● **Ambassador Candidates**: those meeting the thresholds \(with contact links\) 



● **Cadence Queue**: next 50 scheduled sends \(who, channel, bucket.tag, when\) 



● Inline **Share** prompts only at the moments listed above. 





**6\) How communication feels \(tone & safety\) **

● **Texts** are short, human, and contextual \(“Hey \{first\}, I can hold Friday 2pm or notify you if sooner pops up—prefer soonest or anytime?”\). 



● No wal -of-text; any emotional copy is stil respectful. 



● **STOP/HELP** always works; BrandVX records consent and backs off immediately. 



● If there’s **no phone**, BrandVX uses email and doesn’t nag. 



● Rate-limits avoid spamming; one fresh attempt per cadence step max. 





**7\) Settings — what operators can change anytime **

● **Reminders**: on/off and timing. 



● **Cadence**: use defaults or tweak copy/intervals per bucket.tag. 



● **Templates**: edit SMS and email copy; preview before publishing. 



● **Share**: enable/disable each inflection point; connect/disconnect socials. 



● **Time Saver**: adjust baseline minutes per task \(we provide sensible defaults\). 



● **Thresholds**: tweak Ambassador criteria \(we default to $25k/mo \+ moderate usage \+ 5 

referrals\). 



● **Privacy**: opt-in/opt-out policies, data export/delete, audit trail. 





**8\) Edge cases — what happens when things go sideways **

● **Double-booking conflict**: BrandVX proposes the next two closest slots and updates the notify-list. 



● **Calendar outage** \(Square/Acuity\): BrandVX apologizes, col ects availability preference, and retries later; operator gets a heads-up. 



● **SMS blocked / carrier error**: BrandVX switches to email if al owed, and logs the failure. 



● **Client says “not interested” **: immediate tag to **Retargeting \(Disinterested\)** with a single thoughtful counteroffer; then park unless they engage. 



● **Client silent 6 months**: moves to **Dead**; we keep minimal audit only. 





**9\) The quiet plumbing \(what’s stored, at a glance\) **

● **Entity** \(preferences, notes\), **Summary** \(tight history\), **Vector** \(semantic recal \), and an **Events Ledger** \(every send/reply/state change\). 



● **Lead Status** keeps bucket, tag, and next\_action\_at so cadences run like clockwork. 



● HubSpot properties stay in sync so operators can work there if they prefer. 





**10\) Definitions of Done \(per area\) **

**Onboarding **

● Can connect HubSpot, Square/Acuity, SendGrid without leaving the flow. 



● CSV import maps common columns automatical y; errors are clear and fixable. 



● “Finish” screen shows exactly what’s live and offers an optional Share. 



**Lead handling **

● Inbound/outbound first text always uses the correct tone and personalization. 



● No phone → email fal back; no email → log and continue without nagging. 



**Cadences **

● Every step respects next\_action\_at and consent. 



● One attempt per step; reply instantly re-routes the contact to Engaged. 



**Booking **

● “Soonest vs Anytime” is asked at the right moments. 



● Notify-list works: opening hits a smal batch of best candidates, first to accept wins. 



**Time Saver **

● Numbers add up and feel believable; operator can tune baselines. 



● Milestones trigger once, create a shareable asset, and never nag again. 



**Sharing **

● Only appears at defined inflection points; one click to copy/post/share. 



● Al shares are logged as events \(prompted, accepted/declined\). 



**Ambassador flag **

● Triggers when **all** three criteria are met. 



● Creates a HubSpot task \+ in-app nudge. 



**Dashboard **

● Cards never feel stale \(update at least daily; Time Saved live\). 



● Cadence Queue is accurate and actionable. 





**11\) Minimal template names \(for GPT-5 to wire\) **

● **Emails \(SendGrid\)** keyed by bucket.tag, e.g., email\_2\_2\_followup, email\_3\_2\_counteroffer. 



● **SMS** templates keyed similarly, e.g., sms\_4\_2\_reminder\_3d. 



● **Share cards**: share\_onboarding, share\_trial\_done, share\_fully\_booked, share\_25k\_month, share\_5\_referrals, share\_top\_post. 





That’s the entire UX in plain language. If the system behaves exactly like this, it’l feel respectful, helpful, and “alive” — and you’l have clean proof of impact \(time and revenue\) without the operator lifting a finger.
