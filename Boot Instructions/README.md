\# Boot Instructions

\#\# Purpose  
The Boot Instructions folder provides the \*\*entry point\*\* for initializing BrandVX in any compatible AI environment.    
It ensures \*\*full technical initialization\*\*, \*\*brand personality loading\*\*, \*\*supplemental context integration\*\*, and \*\*gap closure\*\* before execution begins.

\#\# Core Files in Load Order

1\. \*\*Technical Boot\*\*  
   \- File: \`/curriculum\_core\_runtime/BRANDVX\_TEMPORAL\_RUNTIME\_BOOT.md\`  
   \- Function: Loads operational logic, rules, and process flow for precise technical execution.

2\. \*\*Brand Voice Boot\*\*  
   \- File: \`/app\_brandvx/BRANDVX\_RUNTIME\_BOOT\_BRAND\_VOICE.md\`  
   \- Function: Applies BrandVX tone, UX priorities, and strategic narrative over the technical base.

3\. \*\*Supplemental Context\*\*  
   \- File: \`/boot\_instructions/SUPPLEMENTAL\_CONTEXT.md\`  
   \- Function: Aggregates distilled knowledge from supporting PDFs, MDs, and strategic planning docs.

4\. \*\*System Gap Closure\*\*  
   \- File: \`/boot\_instructions/SYSTEM\_GAP\_CLOSURE.md\`  
   \- Function: Verifies no missing pieces between Technical, Brand, and Context layers; keeps scaling hooks active.

\#\# Initialization Procedure

1\. Load the four core files \*\*in the order above\*\*.    
2\. Ensure \*\*all referenced documents\*\* in each file’s checklist are present and named exactly as specified in the GitHub Repo Docs folder.    
3\. Maintain \*\*rapid load integrity\*\* — do not skip reading due to “summary mode.”    
4\. Once loaded, begin work using the \*\*Master Prompt\*\* to activate runtime alignment.

\#\# Maintenance Rules

\- \*\*Synchronized Updates\*\*: If Technical Boot changes, Brand Boot must be updated to reflect new operational anchors.    
\- \*\*Checklist Verification\*\*: Every load session, confirm all files in each checklist are present.    
\- \*\*Scalability Checks\*\*: Keep hooks for AAA-level growth even when running at MVP scale.
